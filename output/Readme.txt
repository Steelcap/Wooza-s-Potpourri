Wooza's Potpourri

This mod collects some of the (non-gameplay-changing) mods from the NS2 universe, available by the Steam Workshop together. 
Running a lot of different mods together on a NS2 server can cause clients having troubles joining the server due to multiple request to Steam Workshop or an NS2 Backup Server.
Merging all mods into one Mod helps clients having no issues to download the files.

The mod contains work from people that did not create this mod: 
- entitytick by NoM
- [Shine] Epsilon and Badges+ by Ghoul
- [Shine] Mod Selector by KeatsAndYeats
- Gorge Heart Healspay and Cuter Gorge Eyes by Skie
- Ready Room Rave by Samus Orphan Black
Thank you all for providing and sharing the code

Wonitor a Server statistic tool is included. A tutorial to track stats can be found here: https://github.com/eBrute/wonitor

You have the permission to use all files for your own purpose (despite of entitytick, ask the modder or creator of this mod for permission). 
Be fair and include to mention the authors.
