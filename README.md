#Wooza's Potpourri

This mod collects some of the (non-gameplay-changing) mods from the NS2 universe, available on the Steam Workshop together.

[h1]Idea of this Mod[/h1]
Running a lot of different mods together on a NS2 server can cause clients having troubles joining the server due to multiple request to Steam Workshop or an NS2 Backup Server (which is in a broken state).

Merging all mods into one Mod helps clients having no issues to download the files.

The Mod is used on all Apheriox servers (Wooza's Playground, Hamster Wheel, etc.) and free to be used for all server operators.

[h1]Custom Badges & Shoulder Patches[/h1]
A tutorial for creating an own custom badge or shoulder patch can be found here -> [url=http://apheriox.com/showthread.php/12-HOW-TO-Create-your-own-Badge]Badge Tutorial[/url] or [url=http://apheriox.com/showthread.php/2856-HOW-TO-Create-your-own-Shoulder-Patch]Patches Tutorial[/url]. You can send as many as you want. I will update the mod every 2 weeks, if your badges or patches does not get displayed, you might have sent a wrong ns2 id.
